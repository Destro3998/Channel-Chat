# Channel-Chat Web App

This project is a university project where I developed a **Channel-Chat Web App**â€”a social platform where users can sign up, log in, and post their daily activities, texts, and images. Users can socialize with others in the channel and interact through shared posts.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to the platform.
- **Posting Activities**: Users can post text-based and image-based updates.
- **Social Interaction**: All users in a channel can view and interact with others' posts (via likes, comments,share) promoting socialization.
- **Database Integration**: User information and posts are stored and managed using SQL.
- **Dockerized Application**: Docker was used to containerize the application, making it easy to deploy across different environments.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Express.js, .NET
- **Database**: SQL
- **Frontend Libraries**: Axios.js, React Query
- **File Upload**: Multer
- **Containerization**: Docker
